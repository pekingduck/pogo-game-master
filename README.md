# Pokemon GO Game Master
A repository of Game Master files of Pokemon GO.

`current*` are the most up-to-date Game Master in various formats.

`archive/` contains previous versions of the Game Master.

I'll try to update this repo whenever a new version becomes available.
If it's not up-to-date, you're welcome to submit an issue.
